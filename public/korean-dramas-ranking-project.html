<h1>The Best Korean Dramas According to Diane</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Korean Dramas of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Crash Landing on You</h3>
<p>I watched it around 2020, pandemic time, and I would say that it's still one of the best Korean dramas out there. The two co-stars married years later.</p>

<h3>Itaewon Class</h3>
<p>Wholesome plot. Great acting. I love PSJ.</p>

<h3>Business Proposal</h3>
<p>The plot is refreshing, with funny storylines and beautiful visual actors and actresses. I've felt a lot of "kilig" from the supporting actors as well.</p>
